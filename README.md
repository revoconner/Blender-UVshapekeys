# Blender UVshapekeys
## Only works on blender 4.0 or above
Blender shapekeys based on UV layout, instead of vertex ID (can have different vertex numbers).

Takes the shapekeys corresponding vertices based on UV coordinates instead of vertex ID.

### Update 2.2 : Added save deformation to mesh option so you can retain the UV shapekeys deformation on the mesh data itself for further modifications.
